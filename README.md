# Transformer

## Update
 I have been trying to get the code live as soon as possible but as it seems, it wont be possible for me to get it done before the end of October.
 
This repo will contain code on the transformer architecture that I have coded in Tensorflow 2. I will try and make sure there are some easy-to-use jupyter notebooks available too and some training scripts that would help test its functionality relatively easily.<br>

So far, I have finished implementing and testing the single-layered encoder-decoder transformer. I am now trying to get the multi-layered architecture done too. Hopefully, will get it done in a month or so.<br>

Will upload code to this repository by mid of September Inshallah. The code will contain easy-to-use jupyter notebooks that would hopefully demonstrate the working of this model.<br>
